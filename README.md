# Connect Four dApp (decentralized App)

## Prerequisite:
`npm install -g truffle`

## To run locally:
```
rm -rf build 
truffle develop
> compile
> migrate
```

Note: The `rm -rf build` is necessary because of the mix up between the contracts output and the npm builds for github pages that clash

## To open the frontend, type in another console: 
`npm run start`
